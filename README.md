# phylloglossum_editing
Open access data and methodology for detecting RNA editing events in the chloroplast and mitochondria of the Western Australian lycophyte Phylloglossum drummondii.

This repository contains the code used to create figures presented in The Plant Journal article "Insights into U-to-C editing from the lycophyte Phylloglossum drummondii", as well as code for identifying RNA editing sites within chloroplast and mitochondrion transcripts using the Julia program 'pyrimid', and associated RNA editing Jupyter notebooks which operate with a Julia kernal.
